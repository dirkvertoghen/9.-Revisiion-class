Question 1. The following financial information relates to an investment project (in present value, $):
       
         •	Sales revenue:		50 025
         •	Variable costs:		25 475
         •	Contribution:		24 550
         •	Fixed costs:		18 250
         •	Operating income:	6 300
         •	Initial investment:	5 000
         •	Net present value:	1 300
Calculate the sensitivity of the NPV of the investment project to a change in the a) sales volume; b) amount of the initial investment. Provide for necessary calculations.

Question 2. A production company is assessing a proposal to acquire a machine. A net present value appraisal of the proposal has been carried out and the investment would have a large positive net present value. A decision has therefore been made to go ahead with the project. However, a decision has not yet been made about how the acquisition of the machine should be financed. 
The machine would cost $1 440 000. Capital allowances would be available on a reducing balance basis at the rate of 25% per year. The company has sufficient profits to make use of the allowances in full at the earliest available time. Tax is payable on profits at the rate of 30% and tax liabilities are settled one year in arrears. The machine would be used for three years, and at the end of that time it would be sold for an estimated $225 000. If the machine is purchased, annual maintenance costs of $90 000 would be incurred. If the machine is purchased, the purchase would be funded by a three-year bank loan at a gross interest cost of 10%. An alternative to purchasing the machine is a three-year operating lease. The annual lease rental would be $620 000, payable each year in advance. 

Evaluate whether the company should buy or lease the machine.


Question 3. Asset-based business valuations using net realisable values are useful in which of the following situations?
1.	When the company is being bought for the earnings/cash flow that all of its assets can produce in the future
2.	For asset stripping 
3.	To identify a maximum price in a takeover
4.	When the company has a highly-skilled workforce

Question 4. Sunrise Drive Inc. has a current share price of $55 per share at the last close. Its peer, AHA, has two million common shares outstanding. Based on firm valuation of $140 million using a FCFF model, debt of $40 million, finance cost of $2,4 million and non-operating assets of $10 million. Estimate whether AHA is over-, under- or fairly valued.

Question 5. The following is the information regarding Best Done Co.:
Net income = $650 000
Interest expense = $21 250
Depreciation expense = $32 500
Impairment of goodwill = $24 280
Amortization of long-term bond discounts = $6 255
Capital expenditures = $250 670
Proceeds from sale of long-term assets = $82 500
Working capital investment = $71 300
Given a tax rate of 35%, calculate the free cash flow to the firm.


Question 6. When performing capital budgeting appraisals, using an accelerated depreciation method vs. straight-line depreciation for tax purposes will most likely result in:
1.	Higher NPV. 
2.	Lower NPV. 
3.	No change in NPV.
   
Question 7. For the next four years, annual dividends of a stock are expected to be 5p, 5p, 6p, and 7p. After four years, the cum-dividend price of the stock is expected to be 110p. If the required return on equity is 8%, estimate the value of the stock today.

Question 8. Alpha Company has voted to issue a dividend to common equity shareholders. This dividend will most likely: 
1.	reduce calculated free cash flow to firm (FCFF). 
2.	increase calculated FCFF. 
3.	have no effect on calculated FCFF. 


Question 9. In the context of bonds, accrued interest:
1.	Equals interest earned from the previous coupon to the sale date 
2.	Is discounted along with other cash flows to arrive at the full price
3.	Covers the part of the next coupon payment not earned by seller



Question 10. A company’s investment budget is limited to $100mil. Management is assessing four divisible projects with the investment outlays and net present values as follows: 
     
      Project	                1	    2    	3	    4
      Initial outlay	        40	  30	  50	  60
      NPV	                     5	   6	   8	   5


Estimate the NPV (in $m) generated from the optimum investment program.
Question 11. The following potential cash flows are forecasted for personnel costs for a Company A: 
          
          Year	Cash flow in $m	  Probability, %
            2    	  19	                30
            2	      26	                70
            3	      21	                40
            3    	  25	                20
            3	      31	                40
The A’s cost of capital is 12% p.a. What is the expected PV of the personnel costs for Year 3 to one decimal point?

Question 12.  A company is considering buying a machine costing $250 000 with a useful life of 4 years. At the end of the year 4 the machine is expected to have a scrap value of $5 000. The company can claim tax-allowable depreciation on a 30% reducing balance basis. Corporate tax rate is 30%. What nominal amount of tax relief will be received by the company in year 3?


Question 13. Delivery company operates a fleet of 30 cars. Management is reviewing the company policy on the frequency with which the cars are replaced. Because of problems with reliability of the cars as they get older, it has been decided that cars should not be kept for longer than three years before replacement, but management are reviewing the current policy of replacing cars annually
Each car costs $40,000 new. Its trade in value declines with age, as follows:

            Age,         years	Trade-in value, $
              1	          25 000
              2	          15 000
              3	           1 000

Servicing and repair costs are on average $2 500 in the first year, and this cost would be expected to increase by 30% in the second year and a further 50% in the third year. Cars are also sent for cleaning regularly. Cleaning costs are $600 per car in the first year, rising by 10% per year. The company has a cost of capital of 10%. Taxation and inflation should be ignored. 
**Using the equivalent annual cost method, calculate whether the company should replace its cars after one year, two years or three years**

14. Question 14. FLG Co has annual credit sales of $4,2 million and cost of sales of $1,89 million. Current assets consist of inventory and accounts receivable. Current liabilities consist of accounts payable and an overdraft with an average interest rate of 7% per year. The company gives two months’ credit to its customers and is allowed, on average, one month’s credit by trade suppliers. It has an operating cycle of three months. 
Other relevant information: 
      Current ratio of FLG Co is 1,4;
      Cost of long-term finance of FLG Co is 11%.

**(1) Calculate the size of the overdraft of FLG Co, the net working capital of the company and the total cost of financing its current assets.**

FLG Co wishes to minimise its inventory costs. Annual demand for a raw material costing $12 per unit is 60 000 units per year. Inventory management costs for this raw material are as follows: 
    Ordering cost: $6 per order 
    Holding cost: $0,5 per unit per year 

The supplier of this raw material has offered a bulk purchase discount of 1% for orders of 10 000 units or more. If bulk purchase orders are made regularly, it is expected that annual holding cost for this raw material will increase to $2 per unit per year.

**(2) Calculate the total cost of inventory for the raw material when using the economic order quantity.** 

**(3) Determine whether accepting the discount offered by the supplier will minimise the total cost of inventory for the raw material.**
